# Linux Basics

* <b> What is Operating System ?</b>  
Operating system is an interface between user and the computer hardware. The hardware of the computer cannot understand the human readable language as it works on binaries i.e. 0's and 1's. Also it is very tough for humans to understand the binary language, in such case we need an interface which can translate human language to hardware and vice-versa for effective communication. 

* <b> Types of Operating System:</b>   
  * Single User - Single Tasking Operating System   
  * Single User - Multitasking Operating System   
  * Multi User - Multitasking Operating System
